### Customizing Uniform

There are **two ways** you can customize Uniform to fit your project needs, **Basic** and **Native**. The Basic way to configure Uniform is to simply apply CSS variable overrides inside the `:root` pseudo element. The native method requires a native Sass implementation and overrides are performed in the form of a <a class="hover.underline" href="https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use#configuration">module configuration</a>.

### Basic Configuration üçº

The basic configuration method is the easiest way to customize and get started with Uniform. This method only allows you to customize basic attributes such as **fonts**, **colors**, and **sizes** etc. It does not however, allow you to perform more deeper customizations such as apply a prefix or enable/disable the important tag etc. 

Lets assume you have included a pre-packaged CDN version of Uniform into your project. To apply basic configuration, simply apply CSS variable overrides inside a `:root` pseudo element.

```css
:root {
  --font-sans: 'Open Sans', Helvetica, Arial, Sans-Serif;
  --red-500: #FF4242;
  --btn-radius: 4px;
}
```

### Native Configuration üòé

The native configuration method is the best way to take full advantage of Uniform's customization features. You can customize almost every aspect of this framework using the new and awesome <a class="hover.underline" href="https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use#configuration">module configuration</a> method.

To apply native configuration, pass-through Sass variable overrides to the Uniform module in your Sass stylesheet.

```scss
// styles.scss
@use "uniform" as * with (
  $prefix: myPrefix-,
  $important: true,
  $colors: (
    juicy-color: #F3F5FA,
  ),
  ...
);
```

```css
/* styles.css */
.myPrefix-bg-juicy-color: {
  background-color: #F3F5FA !important;
}
...
```
